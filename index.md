I am interested in optimization, computer vision, machine learning, deep learning and IoT (Internet of Things).

Currently, I am working on my self-portfolio and conducting research in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML).
I graduated from in __Institute of Technology of Cambodia__.
The manuscript of my Engineering research can be found [here](https://monyroth07.github.io/assets/Keo_vonmonyroth_thesis.pdf)
