I am interested in optimization, control of stochastic dynamic system (Reinforcement Learning, Markov Decision Process...), computer vision, machine learning, and deep learning.

Currently, I am the Chief Technology Officer of [AI Farm Robotics Company](https://aifarm.dev).
<!--official at the __Ministry of Industry, Science, Technology, and Innovation of Cambodia__. -->
My Ph.D. was supervised by [Nicolas Gast](https://polaris.imag.fr/nicolas.gast/) and [Bruno Gaujal](https://team.inria.fr/polaris/members/bruno-gaujal/) at __University of Grenoble Alpes of France__.
The manuscript of my Ph.D. can be found [here](https://kimang18.github.io/assets/Kimang_thesis.pdf)
